    <h3>Take a nice evening wok</h3>
    <p>This is a skill everyone should know: how to make a meal out of what you have.
        Basically, just grab anything that looks good in the fridge and throw it in a wok, add some sauce,
        and you are done. Serve it with rice, noodles, a salad, or as it is.
    </p>
    <h4>Pointer on what you could use:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Cucumber</li>
        <li>Left-over meat</li>
        <li>The list goes on...</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your vegetables and your meat into bite size pieces</li>
        <li>If you are using garlic (which you should), mince it or grate it</li>
        <li>Heat your wok until it's really hot</li>
        <li>Add you oil of choice, but don't use an oil with low smoke point like olive or sesame</li>
        <li>Throw in your aromatics, eg. garlic, green onion, onion, ginger, carrot, etc.</li>
        <li>Add your ingredients in the order of longest cooking time first. Raw meat comes before cooked, and so on</li>
        <li>Add some sauce. It could be soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin, ketchup, a mixture of all of the. Something that's deep in flavor. Don't add too much though, you're not looking for a stew</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's it, you've got dinner!</p>
